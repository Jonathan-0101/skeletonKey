# Project Hardware

The schematics and PCB designs for the device are contained in this directory, designed in KiCad.

It would not have been possible to create the project without the assistance of open source designs and resources, most notibly from [Adafruit Industries](https://github.com/adafruit) and [Flipper Devices](https://github.com/flipperdevices)
